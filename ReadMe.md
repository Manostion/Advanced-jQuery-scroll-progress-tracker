## Description

A relatively lightweight (min size ~24KB) jQuery plugin that creates either a horizontal or a vertical (or both) scroll progress indicator based on your content. It is highly customizable and has a built-in linking function, so it can be used as an interactive table of contents.

Using the various options it is also possible to display one tracker (for example vertical) on large screens and another (horizontal in this case) on small screens. On top of that it is very easy to control the position, behaviour and appearance of each tracker individually.

---

## Setup

1. Copy the files from the css and js directories to your corresponding asset directories.
2. Include the advanced-progress-tracker.css or advanced-progress-tracker.min.css in the `<head>`

```html
<link href="css/advanced-progress-tracker.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

3. Include jQuery (if you haven't already) followed by advanced-progress-tracker.js or advanced-progress-tracker.min.js in the `<head>`

```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/advanced-progress-tracker.min.js"></script>
```

4. Initialize the plugin below the included scripts, like so:

```javascript
<script type='text/javascript'>
    $('body').progressTracker();
</script>
```

Or with custom options...

```javascript
<script type='text/javascript'>
    $('body').progressTracker({
        horNumbering: false,
        horTitles: true,
        horMobileOnly: true,
        verTracker: true,
    });
</script>
```
